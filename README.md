# A koa server template for nodejs

This project is an open-source template for building server-side applications using Koa, TypeScript, tsup for building, and integrated ESLint + Prettier for code formatting and linting. It is designed to provide a starting point for developers looking to create robust, scalable, and maintainable web services or APIs.

## Features

- **Koa Framework**: Utilizes Koa for handling HTTP requests with a minimalistic and flexible approach.
- **TypeScript Support**: Leverages TypeScript for strong typing and enhanced development experience.
- **tsup for Building**: Uses tsup for efficient and fast TypeScript compilation.
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Integrated ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and linting, ensuring code quality and style consistency.
- **Advanced REST Architecture**: Features a polished RESTful architecture with efficient route management for streamlined API development.
- **zod-based DTO Validation**: Introduces zod for clear, concise DTO middleware, greatly simplifying data validation and structuring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version recommended: 14.x or later)
- npm/yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siykt/nodejs-server-template.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd nodejs-server-template
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer yarn,

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

### Running the Server

To start the server in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or using yarn,

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server will reload automatically on file changes thanks to ts-node-dev.

### Building the Project

To compile TypeScript to JavaScript, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or using yarn,

```bash
yarn build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` folder.
